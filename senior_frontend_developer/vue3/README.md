# Technical Test for Nuxt 3 Developer

**Objective**: Evaluate technical and analytical skills in frontend development with Nuxt 3 and associated technologies.

**Duration**: 3-4 hours

## ðŸ“‹ STEP 1: Implement a Simple Web Application

### Description:
In this step, we want to see your basic skills in Nuxt 3. The task is to develop a web application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. Users should be able to view, add, edit, and delete tasks.

### Technical Requirements:

* Use Nuxt 3, Vue Router, and Vuex/Pinia.
* Implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
* Create reusable components for forms and task lists.

## ðŸŽ¨ STEP 2: Styling and Design

### Description:

Here we would like to see your artistic touch and design skills. Make sure the application is pleasant to look at and easy to use.

### Technical Requirements:

* Apply styles to the application using SCSS and BEM.
* Implement a design structure using Flexbox or CSS Grid.
* Ensure the application is responsive and looks good on both mobile and desktop devices.

## ðŸš€ STEP 3: Optimization and Performance

### Description:

In this step, we are interested in seeing how you handle the performance of the application. We want the application to run quickly and efficiently.

### Technical Requirements:

* Implement techniques to improve the application's performance, such as lazy loading for components and image optimization.
* Document the optimization techniques used.

## ðŸ§ª STEP 4: Testing

### Description:

Let's test your code! Here, we want to see how you ensure the quality of your code through unit and integration tests.

### Technical Requirements:

* Write unit tests for at least two components using Jest or Vitest

### ðŸŒŸ Extra:

* Perform an end-to-end test for the user flow (add and delete a task) using Cypress.

## ðŸ“š STEP 5: Documentation

### Description:

Finally, we want to see your skills in documenting your work. Documentation is key to any successful project.

### Technical Requirements:

* Provide brief documentation on how to set up and run the application.
* Include a section describing the technical and design decisions made during development.

## ðŸŒŸ Extra Ball: User Authentication

### Description:

For those who want to go the extra mile, implement a basic user authentication system (registration and login).

### Technical Requirements:

* Use a simulated API to handle authentication (you can use json-server or any similar tool).
* Provide a JSON file with some predefined users.
